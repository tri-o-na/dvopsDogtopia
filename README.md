<!-- PROJECT SHIELDS -->
<!--
*** I'm using markdown "reference style" links for readability.
*** Reference links are enclosed in brackets [ ] instead of parentheses ( ).
*** See the bottom of this document for the declaration of the reference variables
*** for contributors-url, forks-url, etc. This is an optional, concise syntax you may use.

<!-- ABOUT THE DEVOPS DOGTOPIA PROJECT -->

For this project, my team and I are  tasked to create a application utilizing standard continuous integration and delivery techniques,
such as Version Control using Source Code Management tools. 
The web application that my team has chosen is a dog review web application where users can view, read, edit and delete reviews about different breeds of dogs.
This web application is done in Eclipse IDE using jsp and css.
